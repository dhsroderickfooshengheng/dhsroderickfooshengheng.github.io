<h2>About myself</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Roderick Foo. I am a 13 year old studying in Year 1 at <a href="http://dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/website/index.html">Dunman High School</a> in Singapore.
  I was from Rosyth School and am one of the tallest people in my class. I was formerly from the Gifted Education Programme. My current CCA is EDS Drama.</p>
<h2>My Interests</h2>
  <p>I have many interests and things I like doing in my spare time. These include, just to name a few...:
    <ul>
      <li>Trainspotting</li>
      <li>Drawing</li>
      <li>Daydreaming</li>
      <li>Reading</li>
      <li>Surfing the Internet</li>
      <li>Chatting with my friends</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>I am really into transportation, vexillology and mapping. I have travelled to many different places, looking at maps and taking public transport. I prefer to take public transport whenever I can.</p>
